Introduction 
============

    - Angular is the Framework.

    - Angular is the JavaScript Framework.

    - Angular Given by Google.

    - Angular Categorized into 3 Flavours.

            1) AngularJS

            2) Angular2

            3) Angular Material

    - AngularJS, used to develop the web applications by using JavaScript.

    - JavaScript is the Object Based Scripting Language.

    - JavaScript won't follows the OOPS.

    - Angular2 used to build the web applications by using TypeScript.

    - TypeScript is the programming language given by microsoft.

    - TypeScript follows the OOPS.

    - Current Version of Angular2 is "Angular12".

    - Angular Material used to apply Rich UI to web applications as well as mobile applications.

    - Angular follows the MVC Design Pattern.

            M - Model

            V - View

            C - Component

    - TypeScript variables behaves like Model.

            Ex.
                    var data = "data from database soon....";

                    where "data" is the model.

    - HTML,HTML5,Python,"Angular Material",ReactJS,PERL,.....behaves like View.

    - classes behaves like Component.


    Ex.
         class FirstComponent{

         };

         where "FirstComponent" is the Component in MVC Design Pattern.




Installation
************

1) download and install "NodeJS"

    => NodeJS offers different tools like

            1) npm

            2) npx

            3) node

            4) nodemon

            ----
            ----
            ----

    => npm stands for node packaging manager.

    => npm helps to install Angular.


website : https://nodejs.org/en/

file    : node-v16.6.1-x64.msi


2) install "yarn" tool

    yarn tool given by FaceBook.

    yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries.

    we will install yarn tool by using following command.

    > npm install -g yarn

    - "-g" stands for global installation.


3) install "Angular Cli".


    - Cli stands for command line interface

    - Cli helps to create the angular applications


    > npm install -g @angular/cli


4) link the "yarn" tool "cli" tool

    > ng config --global cli.packageManager yarn


5) download and install Visual Studio Code

    website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

    file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.58.2.exe









steps to create the first angular application
*********************************************

1) create angular application

    > ng new firstApp

        where "firstApp" is the name of the angular application


2) switch to angular application

    > cd firstApp

3) execute the angular application

    > ng s -o

    s stands for "serve"

    "-o" stands for open the "default browser"

    default port number of angular application is "4200"



Directory Structure of Angular Application
******************************************

1) e2e

    e2e stands for end to end.

    e2e Directory helps to write the end to end test cases


2) node_modules

    it containes libraries.

    these libraries helps to execute the angular application

3) src / app

    - it is used to deploy our applications.

            => Directives

            => services

            => Components

            => single page applications

                ----
                ----
                ----

    - we should register our applications in "app.module.ts" file.

    - "app.module.ts" file called as registration file / default module file.   


4) src / app / app.component.ts
               app.component.html
               app.component.css
               app.component.spec.ts         


    - when ever we create the angular application, automatically AppComponent is the default component

5) src / assets

        - it is used to deploy the static resources

        Ex.
            images

            xml files

            json files



6) src / environments

    - used to define the application level members.


7) src / favicon.ico

    - this logo representing default logo of angular.

8) src / index.html

    - angular Framework starts the execution from index.html file

    - index.html file called as main template.


9) main.ts

    main.ts file acting as interface file between module and template

    angular Framework starts the execution from "index.html" file

    "index.html" file immidiately executes the "main.ts" file.

    "main.ts" file immidiately executes the "app.module.ts" file

    "app.module.ts" file containes our applications registrations.

    based on our applications registrations, angular Framework will execute applications.
